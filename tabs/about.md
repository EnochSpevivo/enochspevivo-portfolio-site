## who? me?

hey there! i'm gabriel, a front end web developer living in seattle, washington. i'd like you to know that this site is the only place i ever lead with that bit of info, but since we're already talking about it, i love working with javascript (especially in node), though i'm no stranger to client side logic. i've also been known to fraternize with HTML & CSS, and i've developed single page apps and server side, database logic. i'm comfortable working on static sites, dynamic sites, APIs, databases, and all things in between (and beyond). here's just a few of the places i've worked:

* [beachcoders](https://beachcoders.com)
* [hackreactor](https://www.hackreactor.com)
* [glo](https://www.glo.com)
* [recharge](https://rechargepayments.com/)
* [FLS International](https://www.linkedin.com/company/fls-international/)
* [NBC News](https://www.nbcnews.com/)
* [Verys, a West Monroe Company](https://view.westmonroe.com/verys/p/1)
* [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/)

though i have worked with in-house teams (i'm a hoot to chat to at the old water cooler), i transitioned into full time, remote, web development in 2019. i have a great deal of experience with the realities of work-from-home life, and the tools of the remote workforce.

- here's my [résumé](https://docs.google.com/document/d/18aB1gV9nbEsj36O1ULnJs-pF1VNVbuvNH7Hq1EWfCrM/edit?usp=sharing).
- here's my [github](https://github.com/AKingDebased) (though my coolest work is all in private repositories. you're better off reading my [posts](/)).
- here's my [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-gonzalvez-927b51ab/), if you want to see the nice things coworkers have said about me

when trying to impress people at parties, i prefer to talk about my amateur 3d modeling, my growing stable of 3d printers, prop making, weightlifting, magic: the gathering, and my ongoing quest to find a way to (legally) fight with a sword in my hand, boots on my feet, and a roar in my throat.
