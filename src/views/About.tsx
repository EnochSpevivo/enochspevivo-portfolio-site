                    hey! i'm gabriel. thanks for clicking. i'm a web developer, and i've been doing
                    this professionally (herein defined as "companies willingly pay me to make stuff
                    on the web for them") for 10 years. i also like to type entirely in low caps in
                    order to affect a stylistically "cool" vibe. that's not important to the work i
                    do, but it is true.

                    "web developer" means different things to different people, so, i'd like to get
                    specific for you. specifically, i like to work with javascript. it's my home
                    base. as such, most of my experience is in building web <em>applications</em>.
                    that is to say, i have years of experience building user authentication systems,
                    2D floor plan sketching tools, multiplayer games, persistent user settings, and
                    much more besides.
