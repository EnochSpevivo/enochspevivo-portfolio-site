hey there! if you came here from my portfolio site, i want you to know, you are a very [hoopy frood](https://hitchhikers.fandom.com/wiki/Frood) who knows exactly where their towel is at.

my shoehorned douglas adams references aside, this site was statically generated using [gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/). the theme and design is all made by yours, truly. i'm using [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) as my CSS framework of choice.

if for some curious — yet exciting — reason you are interested in cloning this repo and running my portfolio locally, all you need to do is run `npm run develop` in the root and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`. well, you'll also have needed to installed the [gatsby cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gatsby-cli) globally using `npm install -g gatsby-cli`.

and if you're here and thinking to yourself, "i _am_ a hoopy frood, and i know a hoopy frood when i see one", then i encourage you to reach out:

-   send me an [email](mailto:gabriel@enochspevivo.com) (gabriel@enochspevivo.com)
-   send me a message on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-gonzalvez-927b51ab/)

otherwise, keep your towel close, and have a nice day!
